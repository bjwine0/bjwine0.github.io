                        Dog owners can tell you that finding a reliable place to take your pooch to go running or for building up their doggy social skills can be difficult. And when you live in a city like Seattle where backyards and lawns are increasingly hard to come by, a quality off-leash dog park can be a godsend.

                        Even if you already have a beloved dog park, a new experience can bring some new smells and pals for your canine buddy—and break up the monotony for you, too. And fortunately, in a park-heavy park like Seattle, there’s no shortage of quality dog parks to choose from, even if your amenity-rich tech workplace doesn’t offer it as a job perk.

                        A peaceful green island in a sea of traffic, Denny Park lies on the central business district's northern fringe, and is surrounded by major thoroughfares. Broad pathways planted with rhododendrons and azaleas lead to a central circle surrounded by thick crowned maples, pines, and other trees shield the grass and its sprawling occupants from city noises until it's time to return to the working world. The central offices of the Parks Department are at the west end of the park.
